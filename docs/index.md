This is a site dedicated to tips & tricks for improving the 
usability and UX of AWS services.

We focus here especially on the [APIs](https://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2016/10/api-usability-matters.html), 
[SDKs](https://softwareas.com/patterns-of-developer-experience/), and [CLIs](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46), 
and less on the console (GUI), covering this in two categories:

- [Resources](resources/): providing links to articles, videos, books, etc. 
  on a service-level basis.
- [Recipes](recipes/): providing recipes (tasks) using a simple "Problem"/"Solutions"
  structure.
