# Cross-account operations

## Problem

We recommend, in general, that you use multiple accounts. This is on the one 
hand for dealing with per-account limits, also known as [Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html) 
, and on the other hand it helps with strengthening the [security posture](https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Multi_Account_Security_Strategy.pdf).

The question is now how and where are cross-account operations supported? 

## Solutions

Cross-account operations apply in principle to all services. This doesn't mean
that all services support it out of the box. It usually boils down to  

For a general introduction into the topic you, check out Becky Weiss' re:Invent 2019
talk on [permissions across accounts](https://youtu.be/Zvz-qYYhvMk?t=2852).

 
First off, you have to try and understand [how IAM roles differ from 
resource-based Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html):


> Cross-account access with a resource-based policy has some advantages over
> cross-account access with a role. With a resource that is accessed through 
> a resource-based policy, the principal still works in the trusted account
> and does not have to give up his or her permissions to receive the role 
> permissions. In other words, the principal continues to have access to
> resources in the trusted account at the same time as he or she has access
> to the resource in the trusting account.

So, resource-based policies are attached to a resource while identity-based 
policies are attached to an IAM user, group, or role, with the principal (*who*
is allowed to do something) implicitly set by the entity the policy is attached
to.

Finally, do some hands-on with the tutorial on [delegating access across AWS 
accounts using IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) 
and check out [how to enable cross-account access to the console](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-cross-account-access-to-the-aws-management-console/).

Let's have a look at some service-specific recipes now.

## Conclusion

Using multiple accounts, while recommended, can be challenging. Using available
tools and managed services along with applying good practices makes it a
possible to strengthening your defense-in-depth and also overcome account limits.
