The recipes presented here are using a simple
"Problem"/"Solutions" structure. This means we first describe a concrete
problem or user task at hand. Then we discuss and show potential solutions.

These recipes are usually hands-on and may contain pros and cons of solutions
or explict recommendations for one over the other.
